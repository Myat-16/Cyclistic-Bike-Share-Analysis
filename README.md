# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Analysis
## Data Source - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunnarn/chicago-bicycle-rent-usage
## Business Impact 
1. 1.36M total rides; the dominate month was June with over 600k rides 
2. Classic bikes hit over 70% of trips
3. Member and casual ride counts were nearly equal in June
4.  Weekends saw the highest activity, mainly from casual users
5.  Members rode more during weekdays 

### Approaches 
I utilized the public Kaggle dataset to explore ride trends and user behavior.
🔹 Cleaned and processed millions of rows in Python
🔹 Aggregated and visualized results in Excel, building an interactive dashboard for deep analysis
🔹 Focused on patterns in user types, ride types, and timing

#### Tools that I used:

🔹 Python (for data cleaning and transformation)
🔹 Excel (for dashboard creation and visualization)
